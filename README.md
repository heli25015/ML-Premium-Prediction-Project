# ML-Premium-Prediction-Project

Predicting health insurance premiums can be challenging without data-driven insights. To address this, I built a Health Insurance Premium Prediction App that uses machine learning to provide real-time premium estimates based on a user’s demographic and health information such as age, BMI, number of dependents, smoking status, and region.

Key Features:
• Clean and user-friendly Streamlit interface for real-time predictions
• EDA and feature engineering to extract meaningful patterns from health data
• Regression models and XGBoost to improve prediction accuracy
• Achieved high model performance through metric-based evaluation
• Interactive deployment enabling instant results for any user input

The project involved an end-to-end ML workflow, including data preprocessing, EDA, feature engineering, regression modeling, and deployment as a responsive Streamlit web app for interactive use to simplify insurance premium estimation.
